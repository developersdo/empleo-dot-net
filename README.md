[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/lmek7cwf3g8a2gk3/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/amhed/empleo-dot-net/branch/master)

### What is this ?

The porpuse of this project is to bring a "real-in-production project" experiance for all developers interesting in learning ASP.Net MVC 5 and Xamarin.

This project is here thanks to the initiative of Developers.do and [C#.DO](https://www.facebook.com/groups/csharp.do/)

* Every now and then (mostly every 1 or 2 week) we'll have some virtual meetings ([Hangout](https://hangouts.google.com) or [Zoom](https://zoom.us)) to talk about any particular topic of
the project.
* The virtual meetings are commonly public, we schedule them and share the URL in the [Developers.do facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/devdominicanos) and [Emplea.do's official twitter](https://twitter.com/emplea_do)
* During the meeting all viwers can bring their ideas, opinions and suggestions but bear in mind that they will be challenged so be ready to defend them
* All meetings are uploaded to [Youtube](http://youtube.com/c/Streamelopers) and added to [a playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW-4dWdTuQryzhz1YWfb-JLKmah1f5l1k)

## Roadmap

### Scope
The scope of the project overall, looking at it as a platform is:
- We will only focus on Tech jobs (from techies to techies)
- Worldwide localization of said jobs, someone from DR should be able to eventually find a job in Spain or Argentina for example
- Easiness of distinction between onsite and remote jobs
- Posting should be simple, searching should be easy

All issues should fall into this scope, if an issue you propose is out of the scope then it will probably not be done but write it anyways, everything is open to conversation.
