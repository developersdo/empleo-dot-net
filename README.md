### What is this ?

The purpose of this project is to bring a "real-in-production project" experience for all developers interesting in learning ASP.NET MVC 5 and Xamarin.

This project is here thanks to the initiative of Developers.do and [C#.DO](https://www.facebook.com/groups/csharp.do/)

* Every now and then (mostly every 1 or 2 week) we'll have some virtual meetings ([Hangout](https://hangouts.google.com) or [Zoom](https://zoom.us)) to talk about any particular topic related to this project.
* The virtual meetings are commonly public, we schedule them and share the URL in the [Developers.do facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/devdominicanos) and [Emplea.do's official twitter](https://twitter.com/emplea_do)
* During the meeting all viewers can bring their ideas and suggestions to us, but bear in mind that they will be challenged to defend them.
* All meetings are uploaded to [Youtube](http://youtube.com/c/Streamelopers) and added to [a playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW-4dWdTuQryzhz1YWfb-JLKmah1f5l1k)

## Roadmap

### Scope
The scope of the project overall, looking at it as a platform is:
- We will only focus on Tech jobs (from Tech-ies to Tech-ies).
- Worldwide localization of said jobs, someone from DR should be able to eventually find a job in Spain or Argentina.
- Easiness of distinction between onsite and remote jobs.
- Posting should be simple, searching must be easy.

All issues should fall into this scope. If an issue you present is out of the scope, then it will probably not be done but write it anyways. Everything is open to conversation.

### Stage 1 - Get it running

* Basics concepts of [git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) for team development, forking, pull request, etc...
* Basics concepts of ASP.NET MVC.
* Use Case definitions (What should do the app?).
* Basics MVC structure.
* Entity Framework [Code-First](http://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/code-first/what-is-code-first.aspx).
* Viewmodals and Views Rendering.
* Security Layer.
